# my personal gnome preferences
Simple bash script which will configure gnome for my very personal preferences. It makes using the gnome shell more natural for me, feel free to use, modify or adapt.

* launch new instance of an application on icon click instead of focus existing window
* activate weekdays in calendar widget
* switch windows instead of applications with alt + tab: The default setting will group windows of same application and you have to use cursor keys to navigate throw open windows of the same application. I personal like to switch between windows using alt + tab without this grouping.
